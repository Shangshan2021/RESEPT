# About

```RESEPT``` is a deep-learning framework for characterizing and visualizing tissue architecture from spatially resolved transcriptomics. 

Given inputs as gene expression or RNA velocity, ```RESEPT``` learns a three-dimensional embedding with a spatial retained graph neural network from the spatial transcriptomics. The embedding is then visualized by mapping as color channels in an RGB image and segmented with a supervised convolutional neural network model for inferring the tissue architecture accurately.
